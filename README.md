i3 Tools
========

A small collection of tools to make life with i3 on
multiple monitors more betterer.

* `i3-get-mouse-screen`

Simply returns the xrandr name of the screen that the mouse is
currently in. Uses caching to get round the small delay that
`xrandr` causes.

* `i3-move-workspace`

A small script to both move windows to workspaces and
to switch between workspaces. Ties workspaces to monitors
and names those workspaces after the monitor they are on.
